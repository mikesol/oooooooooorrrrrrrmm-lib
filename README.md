# oooooooooorrrrrrrmm-lib

A sm√∂l PureScript library for working with SQL generated by [`oooooooooorrrrrrrmm`](https://github.com/mikesol/oooooooooorrrrrrrmm).

It currently consists of two functions, both of which are in the test.

- `toValues`: converts a record to an array of values consumable by `pg`.
- `useMaybe`: takes a `pg` return type with `Nullable` entires and converts them to `Maybe`s.

```purescript
vals :: Array Foreign
vals = toValues { "$1": 42, "$2": "hello" }

ret :: Array { id :: Int, name :: Maybe String }
ret = useMaybe [ { id: 42, name: notNull "hello" }, { id: 43, name: null } ]
```
